## üî¥ CRITICAL CORRECTIONS MADE

### **Section 3.6 - Adding Players to Competition (MAJOR FIX)**

**‚ùå ORIGINAL INCORRECT CONTENT:**
```
Navigate to 'My Competitions' and select your competition
Go to 'Clubs' tab, find your club, click 'Player' button
Select CONFIRMED players (max 14, min 10), enter shirt numbers
Click 'Add Selected', then change status to SUBMITTED
```

**‚úÖ CORRECTED CONTENT:**
```
Navigate to 'My Competitions' and select your competition
Go to 'Clubs' tab, find your club, click 'Player' button
Select CONFIRMED players and enter shirt numbers

COMPETITION-SPECIFIC ROSTER LIMITS:
‚Ä¢ National Championships (Adult/Senior): 15-21 players (min 1 goalkeeper)
‚Ä¢ National Championships (Youth U-17/U-15): 15-20 players (min 1 goalkeeper)  
‚Ä¢ PDP Championship: 16-20 players (min 1 goalkeeper)
‚Ä¢ Masters Championship: 15-21 players (min 1 goalkeeper)
‚Ä¢ Futsal Championship: 10-14 players

Click 'Add Selected', then change status to SUBMITTED
```

**Issue Explanation:** The original guide incorrectly stated "max 14, min 10" which are the roster limits specific to Futsal competitions only. This was misleading for users working with other competition types who have different requirements.
